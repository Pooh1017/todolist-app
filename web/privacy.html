<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App Name:</strong> To-Do List</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2026-02-14</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how the To-Do List application ("we", "our", "app")
collects, uses, and protects information when you use the app.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account information (Google Sign-In / Firebase Authentication):</strong>
      When you sign in with Google, we may receive your email address and basic profile information such as display name.</li>

  <li><strong>To-do content you create:</strong>
      Task and category data you create in the app (for example: <em>title, date, note, done, starred, category name</em>).</li>

  <li><strong>Technical/API data (limited):</strong>
      When you use our API (via Firebase Cloud Functions), requests may include authentication tokens
      and standard request metadata necessary for security and troubleshooting.</li>

  <li><strong>Local storage (on-device):</strong>
      The app may store certain settings and login-related data locally (e.g., last login time and current user email)
      to improve app functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To authenticate you and provide access to the app.</li>
  <li>To create, store, and manage your tasks and categories.</li>
  <li>To sync and retrieve your data from our backend services.</li>
  <li>To maintain security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where Your Data Is Stored</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Firebase Firestore:</strong> Your tasks and categories may be stored under paths like
      <code>users/&lt;uid&gt;/tasks</code> and <code>users/&lt;uid&gt;/categories</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>On your device:</strong> Some app settings may be stored locally on your device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deletion of Tasks</h2>
<p>
When you delete a task, it may be marked as deleted (soft delete) in the database rather than immediately removed,
to support app behavior and data integrity.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
We use Google Firebase services to operate the app, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In)</li>
  <li>Firebase Firestore (database)</li>
  <li>Firebase Cloud Functions (API backend)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These services may process data according to Google's policies.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell your personal information. We share data only:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>With Firebase/Google as required to provide the app services.</li>
  <li>When required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>
We use reasonable security measures to protect your data, including authentication and access controls.
However, no system is completely secure.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We retain your information only as long as necessary to provide the service or comply with legal obligations.
You may request deletion of your data by contacting us.
</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can sign out from Google Sign-In in the app.</li>
  <li>You can request access to or deletion of your data by emailing us.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
This app is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
</p>
